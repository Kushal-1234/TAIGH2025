          The TAIGH Symposium serves as a vital platform to explore how
          artificial intelligence can be applied equitably to address global
          health challenges. With a multidisciplinary approach, the symposium
          invites participants from technology, public health, academia, and
          policy to share research, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and
          develop forward-thinking solutions.
